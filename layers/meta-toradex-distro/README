OpenEmbedded/Yocto DISTRO Layer for Toradex Modules
===================================================

This layer provides the distro configuration used to build the demo BSP images
provided for ARM based Toradex computer on modules (COM).

It follows the poky distro, but does switch to the systemd init system.

For more information on available Toradex COMs please visit:

https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules

Note that the master branch of the layers is where the development is
happening. Do expect build breakage and do not expect us to give a solution.
If you need a more stable base use one of the release branches.
toradex-bsp-platform may have a master manifest tagged to specific layer
versions which likely is more stable than using HEAD.
