OpenEmbedded/Yocto Software Layer for Toradex Demo Images
=========================================================

This layer provides recipes used for demo images targeting ARM based Toradex
computer on modules (COM) featuring NVIDIA Tegra and NXP i.MX SoCs.
For more information on available Toradex COMs please visit:

https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules

Note that the master branch of the layers is where the development is
happening. Do expect build breakage and do not expect us to give a solution.
If you need a more stable base use one of the release branches.
toradex-bsp-platform may have a master manifest tagged to specific layer
versions which likely is more stable than using HEAD.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on the relevant BSP layers for your machine and:
